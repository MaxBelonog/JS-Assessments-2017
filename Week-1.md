#### 2. Describe what "if" does in Javascript.

  //Googled Answer
Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true

#### 3. Write a function that takes one number as a parameter and decides if that number is divisble by three or not. If it is, print the number and "is divisible by three". If it is not, print that the number "is not divisble by three".



var userInput = number;
  if myNumber % 3 == 0 "numberworks"
    myNumber(number.divisble(myNumber));


  (number % 3 == 0){
    number(number.myNumber)
    myNumber
  }


#### 4. What is JSON?

  //Your Answer
  its a file/repository with objects or components used for fast data transfer in react and other languages because its read by most of browsers

  //Googled Answer
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999.
#### 5. Write about yourself in an object, giving at least three properties of you. Then store your object in a variable with your name.
var Max = {
    fullFirstName:"Maksim",
    lastName:"Belonog",
    lives:"San Diego"
};
#### 6. What is a closure?

  //Your Answer
its a function that lets you access var inside and out of its objects (global and local variables)

  //Googled Answer
At first glance, a closure is simply a function defined within another function. However, the power of closures is derived from the fact that the inner function remembers the environment in which it was created. In other words, the inner function has access to the outer function's variables and parameters.
#### 7. What's the difference between =, ==, and === in JavaScript?

  //Your Answer
  = æUsed to define a variable
  == æ Equal to
  === æ has to equal to that exact Answer.
  //Googled Answer
= equal
==	equal to
===	equal value and equal type

#### 8. Create an array with at least 4 items inside it, then access two of the values and console.log() them. Try to access the two values in two different ways.

var loveToDo = [
  'walking my dog',
  'hang with my friends',
  'traveling'
  ];
 console.log(loveToDo.lingth)

loveToDo[0]
  //"walking my dog"
loveToDo[2]
  //loveToDo[2]
"traveling"
#### 9. Describe the different kinds of loops and why you would use them.

  //Your Answer
  for loop
  do while  
  while

  //Googled Answer
for - loops through a block of code a number of times
for/in - loops through the properties of an object
